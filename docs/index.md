# Linux Upskill Challenge
## Learn the skills required to sysadmin a remote Linux server from the command line.


A month-long course aimed at those who aspire to get Linux-related jobs in the industry - junior Linux sysadmin, DevOps-related work, and similar. Server focused and command line, but assumes essentially no prior knowledge, and starts off very gently - designed to be well-suited to a Windows or Apple person as well as those that already using Linux in some form.

This was a paid course in the past, but is now free and fully open source - so costs you nothing but your time!

### What's it about?

1. Learn Linux enough to admin your own server
2. The focus is on practical skills
3. Heavily hands-on
4. Acquire skills during a month, committing of 1-2 hours each day
5. Lots of curated external links
6. Much less ‘formal’ than RHEL or Linux Foundation training

## Start Here

First, take a look at the [FAQ and understand how the challenge works](how-this-works.md), most of your questions will be answered there.

If you’re keen to do this, then you will need your own Internet-exposed server - but full instructions on how to set this up for free or cheap are also provided.

The course restarts on the first Monday of each month so don't worry if you can't make it on your first round!
