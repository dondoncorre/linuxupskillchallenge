# Day 7 - The server and its services

* [Lesson video](https://youtu.be/VzXwO0qq-bg)

## INTRO

Today you'll install a common server application - the Apache2 web server - also known as *httpd* - the "Hyper Text Transport Protocol Daemon"!

If you’re a website professional then you might do things slightly differently, but our focus with this is not on Apache itself, or the website content, but to get a better understanding of:

* application installation
* configuration files
* services
* logs

## YOUR TASKS TODAY

* Install and run apache, transforming your server into a _web server_

## INSTRUCTIONS

* Refresh your list of available packages (apps) by: `sudo apt update` - this takes a moment or two, but ensures that you'll be getting the latest versions.
* Install Apache from the repository with a simple:  `sudo apt install apache2`
* Confirm that it’s running by browsing to _http://[external IP of your server]_  - where you should see a confirmation page.
* Apache is installed as a "service" - a program that starts automatically when the server starts and keeps running whether anyone is logged in or not. Try stopping it with the command: `sudo systemctl stop apache2` - check that the webpage goes dead - then re-start it with `sudo systemctl start apache2` - and check its status with: `systemctl status apache2`.
* As with the vast majority of Linux software, configuration is controlled by files under the _/etc_ directory - check the configuration files under `/etc/apache2`  especially `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` - you can use `less` to simply view them, or the `vim` editor to view and edit as you wish.
* In `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` there's the line with the text: "IncludeOptional conf-enabled/\*.conf". This tells Apache that the \*.conf files in the subdirectory *conf-enabled* should be merged in with those from `/etc/apache2/apache2.conf` at load. This approach of lots of small specific config files is common.
* If you're familiar with configuring web servers, then go crazy, setup some virtual hosts, or add in some mods etc.
* The location of the default webpage is defined by the *DocumentRoot* parameter in the file `/etc/apache2/sites-enabled/000-default.conf`.
* Use `less` or `vim` to view the code of the default page - normally at `/var/www/html/index.html`. This uses fairly complex modern web design - so you might like to browse to [http://165.227.92.20/sample](http://165.227.92.20/sample) where you'll see a much simpler page. Use View Source in your browser to see the code of this, copy it, and then, in your ssh session `sudo vim /var/www/html/index.html` to first delete the existing content, then paste in this simple example - and then edit to your own taste. View the result with your workstation browser by again going to _http://[external IP of your server]_
* As with most Linux services, Apache keeps its logs under the `/var/log` directory - look at the logs in `/var/log/apache2` - in the `access.log` file you should be able to see your session from when you browsed to the test page. Notice that there's an overwhelming amount of detail - this is typical, but in a later lesson you'll learn how to filter out just what you want. Notice the `error.log` file too - hopefully this one will be empty!

### Note for AWS/Azure/GCP/OCI users

Don't forget to add port 80 to your instance security group to allow inbound traffic to your server.

* [Azure](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/answers/questions/1190066/how-can-i-open-a-port-in-azure-so-that-a-constant)

* [Oracle Cloud Infrastructure](https://docs.oracle.com/en-us/iaas/developer-tutorials/tutorials/apache-on-oracle-linux/01-summary.htm#add-ingress-rules)

## POSTING YOUR PROGRESS

Practice your text-editing skills, and allow your "classmates" to judge your progress by editing `/var/www/html/index.html` with `vim` and posting the URL to access it to the forum. (It doesn’t have to be pretty!)

## SECURITY

* As the sysadmin of this server, responsible for its security, you need to be very aware that you've now increased the "attack surface" of your server. In addition to *ssh* on port 22, you are now also exposing the *apache2* code on port 80. Over time the logs may reveal access from a wide range of visiting search engines, and attackers - and that’s perfectly normal.
* If you run the commands: `sudo apt update`, then `sudo apt upgrade`, and accept the suggested upgrades, then you'll have all the latest security updates, and be secure enough for a test environment - but you should re-run this regularly.
